        I went on an adventure trying to change the url from using fragments to
        the more semantic and expected route. You can find my changes that
        accomplished that

        . Angular's routing infrastructure should have been the best way to
        accomplish this. However, there proved to be three main issues with
        using Angular routing for this particular use case.
      </p>
      <h3>
        1. Angular Routing using multiple router outlets
      </h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Angular is really unhappy with having multiple primary router outlets in
        a single file. The behavior is that the last router outlet is the one
        that actually does anything. This can be fixed with auxiliary routes,
        but that adds another issue of a strange looking url. For example, my
        url said "http://localhost:4200/home/(details:details)". This is not a
        url anyone would ever expect. I should be able to fix this issue by
        using a custom url matcher that would allow a route such as
        "/home/details" to match onto the route that normally would have to be
        "/home/(details:details)", but that still doesn't fix the other issues
        that I ran into.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Angular Routing and tab animation behavior</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        One of the best parts of using Angular Material's tabs is the animation
        feature. That is, the animation that occurs when a user switches tabs.
        It looks super nice! The issue with the routing implementation is that
        as soon as the route is switched, the previous component is destroyed
        and deactivates the route. So, the component is no longer displayed as
        the tab changes. Thus, it makes the tab transition not as smooth as one
        would like. This is not an issue when just using tabs on a single page
        since the content never is destroyed and you can see the previous
        component leaving the screen, as if nothing was happening to it.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Angular Routing and State</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The last major issue with Angular Routing is that state is no longer
        maintained between tabs. With the fragments implementation, the property
        preserveContent on the tab group can be set up to maintain state when
        tabs are changed. This is especially useful for the photography tab, so
        that a person can look at a photo, tab over to a different page, and
        then tab back into the photography tab and continue looking where they
        left off. The base implementation also allows the user to continue where
        they stopped scrolling on a previous page. When using Angular Routing,
        this is all no longer the case. When the tab changes, the component is
        destroyed since it leaves the dom on due to routing behavior. Thus, the
        state is not maintained and a new component is created every time the
        tab is changed. There could potentially be fixes for fix with state
        management stuff like NgRx, but I have no looked into possibilities
        here.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Overall, I have decided to go back to my fragments implementation for
        now. I think it provides many more features for less work, is easier to
        understand, and is still somewhat readable for what it is.

        I've been making so many minor tweaks to the site lately.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Firstly, you may notice that many icons have been added. To accomplish
        this, I've decided to use
        <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons">google's material icons</a> .
        They are ubiquitous and easy to use, and are quite fitting to in a
        google framework like Angular. One design philosphy I have always liked
        is that links should generally open in new tabs by default. This
        funcitonality was not added to this blog post due to developer laziness.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        There also has been a new route added to the application. You can find
        it under "/game". This is a very simple game, meant to experiment with
        asynchonrous actions with elements similar to the popular "Cookie
        Clicker". Please give it a try if you have the chance. No promises on
        the quality, but it does have some functionality.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Instead of using additional routes in the /home endpoint, I have added
        fragments. This is to help link to specific parts of the home page.
        Routes, although used in tabs like this often, seemed to work in
        unexpected ways. Since I do not want to rewrite this functionality for
        now, I will keep the fragments. It is a cool demonstration of what kinds
        of things they can do.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I'm sure there are many other changes I've made, but I don't know them
        off the top of my head. So, if you have been here before today, please
        feel free to look around to see if there are any changes that you
        notice.

        This has been a very fun site to work on! Angular is super nifty.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I conceived this homepage initially with the idea of using github pages
        to deploy a new Single Page Application. I wanted to get better at using
        Angular standalone components, theming, material, and various other
        aspects of Angular. So, what better a use of time than to set up a
        homepage website?
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        My core design philosphy is to break apart each section of the site into
        components and orchestrate across components efficiently. Angular
        material provides Tab Groups to efficiently show multiple components in
        the same area. I wanted to initially have a "Details" and "Contact" tab,
        and now I am adding a "Blog" tab. There is no real purpose as to each of
        these tabs, but it gives me something to work on. I've thrown around the
        idea of adding some kind of browser game, but I haven't made any
        progress on what that game should exactly be.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I wanted the mobile experience to be intuitive and easy to use, so I
        integrated hammerjs into the site. I ran into multiple issues, namely
        with tab groups and the way bindings are applied. I ended up using event
        emitters to pass the gestures from the components to the navigation
        component to handle changes in tab. This is frustrating since I'd rather
        not have to duplicate logic everywhere just to handle gestures. For
        instance, creating this blog component required me to copy and paste
        various styles and code. I could probably create my own directives, but
        there should be something that already exists and is flexible enough to
        be used in any application, such as this one. My plan is to figure out
        what a good replacement for hammerjs might be, since it has been 8 years
        since its last update.
